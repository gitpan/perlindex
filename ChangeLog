	Added some regression tests before the CPAN testers beat me up.

        [cpan #2820] Fix indexed directories

        In some perl installations, installsitelib is not part of the
	privlib directory. That is, privlib is something like
	/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.0 and installsitelib something like
	/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0.  This causes the perlindex
	indexer not to dive into installsitelib.

By default, the program perlindex isn't deleted when you do a "make
clean" the result is that the Config.pm constants don't get updated
next time you do a "make all".  To fix this, you can add the following
line to the WriteMakefile() parameters in Makefile.PL:

	      'clean' =>	{ 'FILES' => 'perlindex' },


Nit: Term::ReadKey is more reliable for cbreak than using $d_bsd.  On
HPUX, setting BSD_Style to either 0 or 1 doesn't quite work right.
I've hacked my own copy of perlindex.PL to prefer Term::ReadKey if
available.  Otherwise, it defaults to old behavior execept that it
resolves during "make all" instead of at run time.  (I also insert
"col" between the nroff and the pager to avoid some garbage on HPUX.)
I've included the diffs at the bottom.

	Nroff, man1direxp, privlibexp, prefix and pager are now

	before.
