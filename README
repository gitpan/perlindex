This is the perlindex distribution 

Perlindex is a program to index and search the perl documentation.

The newest version is always available from CPAN/authors/id/ULPFR.

Perlindex should work with any Perl >= 5.002 at least. With Perl >=
5.003_07 it will use compress integers which results in smaller
indices.

To  install do:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make install
        perlindex -index

You may give additional files to index on the command line. I'd
recommend to specify the perl utils (perldoc, h2xs, ...):

        perlindex -index /usr/local/ls6/perl-5.002/bin/*
